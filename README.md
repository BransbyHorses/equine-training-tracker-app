# Equine Training Tracker Application

Application for tracking the time spent training and rehabilitating equines at Bransby Horses Home.

Once you have that up and running clone this repo by finding the directory you want to use on the command line and typing the following;
`git clone https://github.com/BransbyHorses/equine-training-tracker-api.git`
Then cd into that folder
`cd equine-training-tracker-app`
and then run
